Testing project - nothing to see here, move along ;-P 

I'm building all of this stuff myself by hand. 

I'm not using any framework or accelerators, because the point is to learn how 
to do it myself, from scratch, not to learn how to copy/paste someone else's code.

The reason is purely for my own amusement.
