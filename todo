ADMINISTER LISTS
    GENERAL
        
    ATTACK WAVES

ATTACK
    DATABASE
        ==> ensure security of these SPs by insisting on receiving the
            user email address for every request. The UI supplies the email
            as a parameter, based on the currently logged in user in PHP session. 
            The user cannot change the currently logged in user email address
            without supplying the password, and as it is held on the server
            there is no way for the user to spoof this.
            
        + build retrieval SPs for returning:
            x all attacks for a user
            x basic attack details
            x triggers of an attack
            x locations of an attack
            x symptoms of an attack
            x treatments for an attack
            x side effects of treatments for an attack

        x build an updating SP to allow basic attack details to be updated
        
        x build a generic attack-link SP for adding link records for:
            x triggers of an attack
            x locations of an attack
            x symptoms of an attack     
        
        x build a generic attack-link SP for removing link records for all of above.
        
        x build a bespoke SP for adding treatments for an attack to handle dosage, etc.
        
        x build a bespoke SP for adding 3 way links for attack/treatment/side-effect
        

    UI
        + build basic UI for capturing attack events
        + capture related triggers leading to the attack
        + capture pain locations associated with the attack
        + capture symptoms of the attack
        + capture treatments administered
        + capture side effects of the treatments administered
        + Investigate graphical way of representing pain locations? 
        + Investigate graphical way of capturing attack waves
