ADMINISTER LISTS
    GENERAL
        + Consolidate JS for lookup pages into lookup.js
        + Consolidate CSS for lookup pages into a single .css file
        ...bear in mind, these lookups might not be identical always,
           so full consolidation might be a false economy over the long term.
