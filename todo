    SYMPTOMS
        Symptoms List Object
            - updateSymptomsList static method that accepts a symptom list object and
              effects a mass record change back to the database
            - only ADMINS can change existing descriptions. 
            - individual USERS can change their own sort order and hide certain symptoms
